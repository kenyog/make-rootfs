# Creating rootfs(root filesystem) tar-ball for cross-building

This is a collection of scripts for creating root filesystem tar-balls for use in cross-building of various Linux OSes.

Basically, scripts target an architecture other than `amd64`, because of assuming the host of cross-building is `amd64`.
